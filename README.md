This is going to be a mini repo that will hopefully become a nice little website from this

## What is ...this?
Well basically this is going to be a small little project that is going to be more of a little group type of project where we are going to be creating a few pages and a few custom profile pages that hopefully then we are going to create a site out of this.

### Remeber
- fork it
- git clone 'repo'
- git checkout -b 'userName'
- git add . (any new changes)
- git commit -m 'message' (any new changes)
